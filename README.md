# EJMap
Mapping tools such as EPA’s [EJScreen](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) serve to 
identify communities that face disproportionate negative environmental impacts, 
or are particularly vulnerable to those impacts. 

[EJMap](https://nbep.shinyapps.io/ejmap/) (**BETA**) is designed to supplement 
EJScreen with data from additional sources and to allow local communities to 
build and design custom maps that meet their needs and concerns. Data for EJMap
is compiled using the python scripts in the [EJmap_prep repository](https://github.com/NBEP/EJmap_prep).
