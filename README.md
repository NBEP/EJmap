# EJMap
Mapping tools such as EPA’s [EJScreen](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) serve to 
identify communities that face disproportionate negative environmental impacts, 
or are particularly vulnerable to those impacts. 

[EJMap](https://nbep.shinyapps.io/ejmap/) (**BETA**) is designed to supplement 
EJScreen with data from additional sources and to allow local communities to 
build and design custom maps that meet their needs and concerns.

Beta version expected to launch late August/early September 2023. (Need to
