## Title
NBEP_EJMAP_`r format(Sys.Date(), '%Y')`

## Description
Environmental justice metrics in the Narragansett Bay estuary region as 
calculated by the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program (NBEP) 
[**EJMAP**](https://nbep.shinyapps.io/ejmap/) tool. EJMAP provides
population demographics and other information at the U.S. Census block group 
scale. Please review the **technical documentation** for additional information. 

## Data Source
```{r text_dataSource, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
test <- 'this is test'

cat(test)

```

## Data Year
```{r text_dataYear, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cat(test)

```

## Date Published
`r Sys.Date()`

## Use Limitations
```{r text_limitations, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
